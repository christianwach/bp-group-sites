In WordPress Multisite, BuddyPress Group Sites enables the creation of a many-to-many relationship between BuddyPress Groups and WordPress Sites.



== Description ==

The BuddyPress Group Sites plugin enables the creation of a many-to-many relationship between BuddyPress Groups and WordPress Sites. This is useful when you have a BuddyPress network in which you want, say, many groups to comment simultaneously on sites which they share access to.

The plugin is specifically designed to work with CommentPress "documents" (which are themselves complete sub-sites) so that there can be many reading groups for each document and many documents for each reading group.

### Plugin Development
