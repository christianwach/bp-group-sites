BuddyPress Group Sites
======================

The *BuddyPress Group Sites* plugin enables the creation of a many-to-many relationship between BuddyPress Groups and WordPress Sites. This is useful when you have a BuddyPress network in which you want, say, many groups to comment simultaneously on sites which they share access to.

The plugin is specifically designed to work with *CommentPress* "documents" (which are themselves complete sub-sites) so that there can be many reading groups for each document and many documents for each reading group.

### Requirements

This plugin requires a minimum of *BuddyPress 2.0*.

## Installation ##

### GitHub ###

There are two ways to install from GitHub:

If you have downloaded *BuddyPress Group Sites* as a ZIP file from the GitHub repository, do the following to install and activate the plugin and theme:

1. Unzip the .zip file and, if needed, rename the enclosing folder so that the plugin's files are located directly inside `/wp-content/plugins/bp-group-sites`
2. Network activate the plugin
3. You are done!

#### git clone ####

If you have cloned the code from GitHub, it is assumed that you know what you're doing.
