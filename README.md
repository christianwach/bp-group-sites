BP Group Sites
==============

The *BP Group Sites* plugin enables the creation of a many-to-many relationship between *BuddyPress* Groups and *WordPress* Sites. This is useful when you have a *BuddyPress* network in which you want, for example, many groups to comment simultaneously on sites which they share access to.

The plugin is designed to work with [*CommentPress Core*](https://wordpress.org/plugins/commentpress-core/) "documents" (which are themselves complete sub-sites) so that there can be many reading groups for each document and many documents for each reading group.

This plugin was developed for [The Readers' Thoreau](http://commons.digitalthoreau.org/) where it enables multiple reading groups to collectively discuss the works of Henry David Thoreau.

If you're a developer, any contributions are most welcome here. If you're not a developer, it's probably better to install this plugin from the [WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-group-sites/).

### Requirements

This plugin requires a minimum of *WordPress 4.2.1* and *BuddyPress 2.0*.
