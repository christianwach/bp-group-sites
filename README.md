Enables the creation of a many-to-many relationship between *BuddyPress* Groups and *WordPress* Sites in a Multisite context.

## Description

*Please note:* this is the development repository for *BP Group Sites*. The plugin is also available in the [WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-group-sites/), which is the best place to get it from if you're not a developer.

The *BP Group Sites* plugin enables the creation of a many-to-many relationship between *BuddyPress* Groups and *WordPress* Sites. This is useful when you have a *BuddyPress* network in which you want, for example, many groups to comment simultaneously on sites which they share access to.

The plugin is designed to work with [*CommentPress Core*](https://wordpress.org/plugins/commentpress-core/) "documents" (which are themselves complete sub-sites) so that there can be many reading groups for each document and many documents for each reading group.

This plugin was developed for [The Readers' Thoreau](https://commons.digitalthoreau.org/) where it enables multiple reading groups to collectively discuss the works of Henry David Thoreau.

If you're a developer, any contributions are most welcome here. If you're not a developer, it's probably better to install this plugin from the [WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-group-sites/).

### Requirements

This plugin requires a minimum of *WordPress 4.2.1* and *BuddyPress 2.0*.

### BuddyPress 12.x

This plugin has not yet been tested with the new BP Rewrites API in *BuddyPress 12.x*. It is therefore recommended to remain on *BuddyPress 11.4* or install the [BP Classic](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-classic/) plugin until compatibility has been written and tested.

## Installation

### GitHub

There are two ways to install from GitHub:

#### ZIP Download

If you have downloaded *BP Group Sites* as a ZIP file from the GitHub repository, do the following to install and activate the plugin and theme:

1. Unzip the .zip file and, if needed, rename the enclosing folder so that the plugin's files are located directly inside `/wp-content/plugins/bp-group-sites`
2. Network activate the plugin
3. You are done!

#### git clone

If you have cloned the code from GitHub, it is assumed that you know what you're doing.
